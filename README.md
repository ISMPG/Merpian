# About Merpian

Merpian Limited (founded 2019) is a research and development company focused on building **sovereign, federated AI systems**.  
We believe AI should serve people first â€” sovereign, verifiable, and under your control.

Our work explores knowledge engines, adaptive indexing, and resilient distributed architectures that are:

- **Offline-first, mobile-first** â€” designed to work everywhere.  
- **Federated & sovereign** â€” privacy, control, and resilience by default.  
- **Deduplicated & adaptive** â€” atomising data, removing duplication, and enabling intelligent querying at scale.

## Our Projects

### Hqllr â€” Local. Sovereign. Verifiable.

*A hall of knowledge. A guardian of truth. Built for people, families, and communities.*

Hqllr is more than software â€” itâ€™s a **family-built knowledge engine and AI ecosystem** that puts people before platforms.  
We believe knowledge should be:

- **Local-first** â€” your data stays with you, always in your control.  
- **Verifiable** â€” every answer is traceable, every claim accountable.  
- **Adaptive** â€” responses shaped to your persona, context, and needs.  

By combining sovereign design with human values, **Hqllr becomes a trustworthy companion in the age of AI**.
