## About MERPIAN

MERPIAN Limited (Modular Ecosystems for Research into Personal Intelligent Assistive Nodes) founded in 2019, is a research and development company building **sovereign, offline-first AI systems**. Our work bridges deep research in memory, indexing, and reasoning engines with practical tools for individuals, devices, and federated networks.
We believe AI should serve people first — sovereign, verifiable, and under your control.

Our work explores knowledge engines, adaptive indexing, and resilient distributed architectures that are:

- **Offline-first, mobile-first** — designed to work everywhere.  
- **Federated & sovereign** — privacy, control, and resilience by default.  
- **Deduplicated & adaptive** — atomising data, removing duplication, and enabling intelligent querying at scale.

## Our Current Projects

### LMouthful™ — Micro Language Engine

**LMouthful™** is the core language engine inside Hǫllr™/Hqllr™ — a tiny, cache-friendly model designed to run entirely on local hardware, from mobile phones, tablets, desktops to full Hǫllr™ nodes.

> A small mouthful of model. A large appetite for *your* data.

**Why it exists**

LMouthful™ is built to answer a simple question:

> “How far can we get with a small, structured, local model over *your* data — without GPUs, giant checkpoints, or cloud APIs?”

Instead of a single giant black-box network, LMouthful™ sits on top of a layered memory system:

- **GLTM – Global Long-Term Memory**  
  Deduplicated, domain-aware data store: the “truth layer” ingested from books, documents, notes, logs, etc.

- **Personas**  
  Configurable “ways of thinking” and explaining (e.g. student, junior assistant, expert, professor), controlling tone, depth, vocabulary and which parts of GLTM are visible.

- **PSTM – Persona Short-Term Memory**  
  Per-persona working memory: recent queries, answers, retrieved snippets and feedback, used to keep responses coherent and context-aware.

LMouthful™ then uses a compact language model (and planned tiny vector space) to generate short, grounded responses over that memory.

**Key properties**

- **Small, local, sovereign**  
  Designed to fit in single-digit MiB for the core model and run fully offline. No external LLM calls, no hidden cloud dependency.

- **Fast by design**  
  Built around compact structures and CPU-friendly algorithms. Ingest and token generation are tuned for small devices first principles.

- **Grounded in your data**  
  Works over your own GLTM store (documents, books, Obsidian vaults, etc.), using IR/RAG-style retrieval plus a compact model to produce answers with traceable supporting snippets.

- **Persona-aware**  
  Responses are shaped by the active persona’s capabilities and style (from “keep it simple” to “deep technical dive”), rather than one generic voice.

**Intended use cases**

- Local Q&A over personal or organisational knowledge bases  
- Summarisation and explanation using only ingested data  
- On-device assistants that must remain offline and under user control  
- Embedded “micro-LM” behaviour in Hǫllr™ nodes and tools

**Status**

LMouthful™ is currently under active R&D and used internally as the core language engine within the Hǫllr™/Hqllr™ stack. Public demos, benchmarks and further technical details will be released as the project matures.




### Hqllr™ — Local. Sovereign. Verifiable.

*A hall of knowledge. A guardian of truth. Built for businesses, communities and individuals.*

Hqllr™ is more than software — it’s a **knowledge engine and AI ecosystem** that puts people before platforms.  
We believe knowledge should be:

- **Local-first** — your data stays with you, always in your control.  
- **Verifiable** — every answer is traceable, every claim accountable.  
- **Adaptive** — responses shaped to your persona, context, and needs.  

By combining sovereign design with human values, **Hqllr becomes a trustworthy companion in the age of AI**.
