# Etymology & Brand Rationale

Hqllr is derived from the Old Norse word Hǫllr, meaning hall, great house, or guardian.

In Norse culture, the hall (hǫll) was more than a building: it was the heart of the community — a place of sovereignty, trust, memory, and gathering. Chiefs ruled from it, warriors feasted in it, and history was preserved within its walls.

We chose hqllr because it embodies these same values in the digital realm:

- 🏛 The Hall of Information — a shared, monolithic yet sovereign space for data.

- 🛡 Guardian of Truth — append-only, cryptographically verifiable records.

- 🔍 Auditable & Transparent — every entry hashed, every change traceable.

- ♻ Deduplicated & Efficient — data preserved without waste.


By stylizing Hǫllr as hqllr, we achieve:

- Uniqueness & portability — safe in code, URIs, CLIs, filepaths, and metadata.

- Consistency — lowercase hqllr for technical use; capitalized HQllr for branding.

- Identity — the q is a deliberate marker, a visual anchor for our ASCII form of ǫ.


hqllr is both our name and our promise:
a guardian hall of verifiable data.
